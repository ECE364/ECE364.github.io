The standard textbook recommendation for this course is Prof. Jeff Erickson's book simply titled ["Algorithms"](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/). Prof. Erickson spent his sabbatical putting together a textbook that offers a guide into the most useful algorithmic methods and principles. His tome has been updated many times throughout the decade(s) with numerous additional chapters including notes on computability which is a big part of this course. It is a pleasure to read, informative and at times humorous, all the things Prof. Erickson is as a professor. 

That being said, one of my pet peeves are people that argue that one resource is the only one, everyone should use. **If you are basing all your work/knowledge off of a single resource, you are a fool.** All it takes is for that author to make one typo and that error will be propagated into all your work (yes I have seen this). Not only that, but different authors speak different languages and therefore will be appreciated by different audiences. Scientists, engineers, mathematicians all have different priorities/points-of-view and it is best to find resources that match your own educational "language." 

I myself use a variety  of texts when developing course content. For ECE374 in particular, because there is such a variety of material I regularly use five main textbooks for the majority of the content and I would like to share those texts with you:
