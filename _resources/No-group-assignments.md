title: "[Policy explanation] No more group assignments"

description: All assignments in this course must be performed individually. Here is my reasoning why. You don't have to agree, but I hope everyone can respect my perspective.

### Group homeworks

In the past, homeworks could have been completed in groups of at most **three students**. Ideally, the way it should work is that each individual in a group looks at all the problems and comes up with some quick notes on possible solutions. Then the group would come together and attempt to reach a consensus on each problem. Finally, the solution writing and presentation would be divvied up between the members so alleviate some of the presentation burden. However, I personally am conflicted on group work: 

- **Positive:** If done correctly, it can be a powerful way where students learn from and bounce ideas off one-another. That is definitely a good thing. 
- **Negative:** Since this is my seventh time doing this course, I believe about half the groups simply divvy up the problems and don't even look at the problems not assigned to them. I've done a bit of analysis on past semesters where I've had a exam problem that was nearly identical to a homework problem and consistently, there's been about 25-30% of students that clearly have never seen the problem before. 

### Data 


### Conclusion

In summary, have stopped allowing group work. From what I've seen, the strongest performing individuals are over-represented in the group of students that do the homework solo. Also I have reduced the homework burden compared to past semesters so a single person should be fine doing all the problems themselves.
