This is the first time I am teaching the course and as such I am still ironing out the project details. However, the staff and I know that we want to have a final project where you guys build a machine learning model to perform a particular machine learning task. Here are some preliminary details about the project: 

* It will be a group optional project where you may form groups of *up to* three people (you may go it alone, up to you). 
* There will be three machine learning tasks corresponding to three different areas of machine learning (natural-language processing, computer vision, and signal processing).
* You will have to submit your code and a short report (2-3 pages) detailing the method(s) you used and how well you model worked.  
* We will host a leaderboard where groups can submit their models and see how well they stack up to the rest of their coursemates: 
* We will give a prize to the top performing model in each task (something like a full letter grade bump on your final grade, maybe more if it's a one-person team)
* We will also give a prize to the best report (same award as above).

More details will be released right after the first midterm. This project is meant to let everyone have fun and get your feet wet building machine learning models in PyTorch. Hopefully it'll be something you can show off and talk about in interviews.
