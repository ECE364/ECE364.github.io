The final project is designed to give you experience implementing a machine learning model on a real-world dataset—without me telling you what method to use. We want you to explore any creative or unconventional methods you can think of! This is a completely open-ended problem, and the most important thing I want to see is **effort**. So let's go over the project details:

### Topics

There are three project topics covering a range of machine learning tasks:

1. [Identify Chinese characters (computer vision)](materials/project/ECE364_Project_T1_SP25.pdf) — You will be given images containing a mix of handwritten numeric digits and Chinese characters. Your task is to identify and draw bounding boxes around the Chinese characters.
2. [Informative tweets (sentiment analysis)](materials/project/ECE364_Project_T2_SP25.pdf) — Based on the WNUT-2020 competition, you are given a dataset of tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Your job is to identify which tweets are informative.
3. [Virtual bidding in electric markets (trend prediction)](materials/project/ECE364_Project_T3_SP25.pdf) — Develop a classification algorithm and trading strategy to identify profitable trading opportunities.

### Dataset

The datasets are hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/ECE364/projects_sp25).

### Kaggle Competition

To make things more exciting, we are hosting a competition on Kaggle! You will submit your best runs to Kaggle (details are in the project description files).  
The top individual or team for each topic will receive a prize:
- **Individuals**: Full letter grade bump
- **Teams (two or more members)**: Half-letter grade bump

We hope this will encourage you to try new methods and explore the current state-of-the-art models in machine learning.  
We will be verifying the winners and ensuring the submitted numbers come from models that follow the competition rules.  
**Important:** Make sure to set a random seed so that your training is reproducible.

### Teams

You may work in teams of up to three people and only need to complete one of the three project topics. There’s a variety to choose from, so pick the one that interests you most!

### Deliverables

You must submit:
- Your code
- A two-page report describing what you did, what you tried, whether it worked, and what you would do differently next time.

### Due Dates

There are two important deadlines:
- **Kaggle competition closes:** May 5th (Monday before Reading Day)
- **Two-page report due:** May 12th (Monday)
