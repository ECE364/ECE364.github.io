description: What to do if you get covid (or any other illness).

Unfortunately, the Covid situation is here to stay and the normal influenza virus has regained the ground it lost during the pandemic lock-downs. The good news is that we have vaccines that will *mostly* protect us. By being on campus, you are certifying that you are in full compliance with the [university's health policies](https://covid19.illinois.edu/).  

Even so, likely that a number of us will get sick during the semester. So the question is, **what should you do?** 

First, do not come to campus. Stay home and focus on getting better. If you start feeling really sick, go to the doctor. Your health matters more than any grade, so please do your best to recover first. 

* Exams have conflicts, homeworks can be turned in online, and lectures are recorded. Hence, an illness will likely very minimally impact your grade. 

So, in summation, make sure to get better. It is very possible to take this course remotely (for a short while) should you get sick.
