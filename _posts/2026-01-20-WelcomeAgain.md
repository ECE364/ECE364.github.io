And we're back! Welcome to the ECE364 website for the Spring 2026 semester. The site is continuously evolving and will be updated regularly throughout the semester, so be sure to check back often for the latest information. I'm sure there are many typos and such. If you see any errors, please submit an issue in the website's [github repo](https://github.com/ECE364/ECE364.github.io)! Raising issues improves the course site, ups your GitHub participation stats, and will be rewarded in other ways as well!
