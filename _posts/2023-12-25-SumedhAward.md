I am incredibly pleased to announce that Sumedh Vemuganti has won the [Harold L. Olesen Undergraduate Teaching Award](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/grad/awards/olesen)! This is the first time that I know of that someone has won this award in his first semester of being a TA. And you know what, he completely deserves it. Sumedh has gone way above and beyond in his TA duties and he propped me up during a semester when I needed it the most. 

Thank you to those of you that nominated him. We are all blessed to have him and let's keep working hard to make sure our favorite people feel appreciated.
