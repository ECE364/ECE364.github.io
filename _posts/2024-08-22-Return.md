I have returned to teaching ECE374B! I want to thank everyone that wished me well during my hiatus and am excited to be teaching this course again in Fall 2024 with my excellent teaching assistants and my co-instructor Ivan Abraham. I hope we all (students+instructors) have a productive, enjoyable semester!
