For the first time in more than three years, I will not be teaching ECE374. I recently had a baby and am not teaching, so I can better spend time with him. I am sorry to those of you that I have disappointed and wish you all the best. This school is full of amazing professors and I encourage you to give my replacements a chance, and be kind to each other. 

While this has always been a CS course with a syllabus determined by the CS administration, I have tried my best to develop content (including this website) that would make the subject accessible and maybe a bit entertaining. I am maintaining this website so that the content I (and my excellent TA/CAs) developed may always be accessible to future students.

Last note: in Fall2023, I only delivered half the lectures because my son was born. Hence, I mixed links to my Fall2023 and Spring2023 lectures so that all the lecture content I developed is easily accessible. Please pardon any indexing errors since the lecture/lab indices changed between the semesters.
